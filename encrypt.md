You should encrypt all email. Here is my [GPG public key](http://srinivas.gs/sgs.asc) which you can also get from the [MIT key server](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=srinivas.gs) or on [https://keybase.io/srinivas](https://keybase.io/srinivas). Its fingerprint is 

    88C6 D016 6B09 8880 6BF8 
    F253 8C9C B698 D193 4604

You can verify this using


    curl srinivas.gs/sgs.asc |
         gpg --with-fingerprint

You can send me a encrypted message even if you don't know how to use encryption: [click here](https://hawkpost.co/box/6565b695-4f56-4a3a-9075-1b83ff19c026) to do so.
